    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This wine making recipe yields easy homemade wine. You can choose whatever flavor you like, but my favorite is red. To complete this project, you will need a sterile milk jug, a large latex balloon, and a rubber band. This wine is a bit stronger than regular table wine and is excellent for cooking and drinking.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="ingredient">Sugar</span> - 4 cups</li>
        <li><span class="ingredient">Frozen juice concentrate</span> - 12 fluid ounce</li>
        <li><span class="ingredient">Active dry yeast</span> - .25 ounce</li>
        <li><span class="ingredient">Cold water</span> - 3Â½ quarts</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Combine sugar, juice concentrate, and yeast in a 1-gallon jug. Fill the jug the rest of the way with cold water. Stir or shake well until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is well combined.</li>
        <li>Rinse out a large balloon; fit it over the opening of the jug. Secure the balloon with a rubber band.</li>
        <li>Place jug in a cool dark place. Within a day, you will notice the balloon starting to expand. As sugar turns to alcohol, gasses will release and fill up the balloon.</li>
        <li>When the balloon has deflated, wine is ready to drink. It takes about 6 weeks total.</li>
    </ol>
